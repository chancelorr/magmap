This folder contains fortran codes magmap.f and color.f and their executables magmap and
color, plus some examples.

magmap can be used to predict the magnetic field from IGRF models which are  supplied internally
within the program, or from a user supplied spherical harmonic field model.

Mutliple options for use are described in documentation in magmap.pdf
Executable version is magmap
Source code is in magmap.f
To compile in a UNix shell
% gfortran magmap.f -o magmap
to run using commnads provided in Magin
% magmap <Magin
This produces IGRF 2020 prediction at the specified locations
First task is to check these are correct as magmap was just updated to contain post-2010
IGRFs, and haven't checked it yet.

Check using one of the online calculator http://www.geomag.bgs.ac.uk/data_service/models_compass/igrf_calc.html

If all looks ok then can try the mapping tool. See e.g ex4mgp.txt
% magmap <ex4mgp.txt

This outputs a grid of radial field values at the core-mantle boundary for plotting using
color. 2 field models are used in ex4mpg.txt--  OIFM  (externally supplied) and IGRF contained in magmap

$color <tmp.plt

produces a postcsript output file (default labeled "mypost"), can be viewed  in X windows with ghostscript
% gs mypost
